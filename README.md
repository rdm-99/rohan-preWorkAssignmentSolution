PreWork Assignment
Description:

Write a program that performs multiple operations:

1. check for palindrome number
2. prints the pattern of stars in decreasing order based on the input
3. check whether the input number is a prime number
4. print Fibonacci series of size n with first two numbers as 0, 1
 
Using Switch case and do-While loop provide all the above functionality, such that user can select the functions that he/she needs to perform and exit the program based on the input.

Function Explanations in Brief: 

*Palindrome number*:
 
The numbers which give the same value when reversed are called palindrome numbers.
Example: 121, 12321, 512215, etc.,

*Pattern of stars*: 
 
Based on the input integer, the levels in the pattern and the number of stars in each level are decided. At every level, the number of stars is 1 less than the previous level.
Example: If the input number is 4, then the output will be

****
***
**
*

 if input no is 5, then the output will be

*****
****
***
**
*

If input no is 2, then the output will be

**
*

*Prime number*: 

The numbers which are only divisible by 1 & themselves are called prime numbers. 
(Or) 
The numbers which have factors 1 and themselves are called prime numbers.

Example_1: If the input number is 23
Factors of 23 are 1, 23, and other than 1 it  is divisible by 23 only
Hence the number is prime.

Example_2: If the input number is 22
Factors of 22 are 1,2, 11, 22 and are divisible by 2 and 11.
Hence the number is not a prime number.

*Fibonacci series*: 

The series of numbers whose next number is the sum of its previous two numbers is called the Fibonacci series.
Example_1: If the input number is 5,
The Fibonacci series  is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 (by default first two numbers are 0,1 (hardcoded), and we need to calculate the other nos in series)

Example_2: If the input number is 7
The Fibonacci series is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 , 8

*Exit*:

The program should ask the user to choose the task they want to perform after executing a task, till choice 0 is entered to exit the program.
